# machine-coding

List of machine coding problem statements for interviews or just for practice. 

I tend to apply my knowlege directly while appearing for interviews, without pracitcing in a limted time window.

Trying to solve the problems in a typical 1 Hr to 2.5 Hrs slot. There may be some improvements later on, as github history don't lie. (Refer master branch of the submodules for consecutive updates)
